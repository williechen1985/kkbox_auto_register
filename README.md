# kkbox_auto_register
This is a project started at March 2012 when I was 15 years old. This project's purpose is to automatic register KKBOX free trial account.
This project was build with JAVA and using http methods. By adding some setting value just like a normal browser using by a person so the system won't find out this is just a program.
By using 10 minutes mail API, this project had 5 different domains then and unlimited radom account email.
